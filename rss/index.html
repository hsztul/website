<p>We would sit down, setup the board, my father would pick up two pawns, put them behind his back, and he would ask me to pick.</p>

<p>Sometimes I picked white. Sometimes I picked black. <br>
It didn&apos;t really matter. We just played.</p>

<p>No matter how it began, I always tried my hardest to win. No matter how hard I tried, however, I never came out on top.** No matter what, at the end of any game, no matter how heated things got, we always shook hands.</p>

<p>As I got older I started to see the gears turning in my Dad&apos;s head, I started figuring out the subtleties of the game. One day the unthinkable happened.</p>

<p>I won.</p>

<p>For a brief moment I remember being so happy. And then I realized things had just changed. I beat my father in chess. And like always we shook hands.</p>

<p><strong>Fast forward 20-ish years</strong>... I have a 5 year old daughter.</p>

<p>Last weekend I played <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=old+maid+card+game&amp;ref=localhost">Old Maid</a> with her for the first time. We were sitting on a lawn on top of a blanket and I dealt the cards. While Old Maid is no Chess there is some strategy involved and after the first game my daughter figured it out. </p>

<p>I saw the gears turning in her head. I saw her figuring it out. <br>
I saw her trying to win. </p>

<p>Well, she lost two games and then... won one! She was so happy and proud, but I could tell she realized something. She beat her dad.</p>

<p>Taking a step back from my Old Maid extravaganza, what came back to me from chess games with my father, was that losing really does teach you how to win. What you do when you win is just as important as what you do when you lose.</p>

<p>When my daughter beat me in Old Maid, you know what we did? We shook hands.</p>

<p>I can&apos;t wait to to play her in chess!</p>

<hr> 

<p>** My father might have let me win once to give me a taste of winning, but modus operandi was he tried to win. So did I.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah! An update to Chrome, those guys are awesome!</p>

<p>OK, Chrome restarted and low and behold, my new tab page is missing the &apos;Other devices&apos; section. I love that thing!</p>

<p>This is a killer feature that lets me open pages in tabs on my phone, iPad, or elsewhere and get to them from my desktop (or vica verca).</p>

<p>What&apos;s a man to do? <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=chrome+new+tab+missing+other+devices&amp;ref=localhost">Google it</a>! A fix!</p>

<p>And all was good! Until this week. Version 33 of Chrome released this week, got rid of the chrome flag that fixed this issue.</p>

<p>So today I went to Twitter to find the solution, and here it is:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" style="text-align:center;"><p>I stand corrected, <a href="https://twitter.com/r4vi?ref=localhost">@r4vi</a> is correctamundo! visit the hamburger, under &apos;recent tabs&apos; Other devices is just really hidden now in <a href="https://twitter.com/googlechrome?ref=localhost">@googlechrome</a></p>&#x2014; Henry Sztul (@sztul) <a href="https://twitter.com/sztul/statuses/441242948814921729?ref=localhost">March 5, 2014</a></blockquote>  

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>So there you go. On your desktop version of chrome, look for the hamburger (see image below) and tabs on other devices are listed under &apos;Recent tabs&apos;</p>

<p><img src="https://henry.sztul.com/content/images/2014/Mar/Screen_Shot_2014_03_05_at_11_27_56_AM.jpg" alt="Missing &apos;Other Devices&apos; Tab in Google Chrome? Read this!"></p>

<p>[UPDATE #1] Even better! Check out this page in Chrome:
<a href="chrome://history/">chrome://history/</a></p>

<p>It was also updated to have tab info from other devices. Awesome.</p>

<p><br> <br>
Last week you were quoted (<a href="http://www.beet.tv/2014/01/touchcastvanilla.html?ref=localhost">video here</a>) as saying: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;We don&#x2019;t think plain vanilla video is the native experience people expect when they&#x2019;re watching online on their tablets. You expect to touch it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hear you. And in many other cases I would agree with you. </p>

<p><strong>But I have to call bullshit on this one.</strong> The argument you are trying to make is too nuanced to say &quot;people expect&quot; more interactive video.</p>

<p>The many millions of people <em>watching</em> video online are most certainly <strong>not</strong> looking to touch the video they are watching while watching it.</p>

<p>To understand what people might <em>want</em> to do while watching video on their tablets, you need to understand <strong>what</strong> they are watching and <strong>when</strong> they are watching video on their tablets. Only then will you understand <strong>what they want to do with that video when they are watching</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="whattheyarewatching">What they are watching</h3>

<p>A recent <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Do-People-Watch-Video-Differently-on-Mobile-Phones-vs-Tablets/1009733?ref=localhost">eMarketer study</a> shows that people are watching more longer form content, including movies and TV shows, on their iPads. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>People are watching movies 25% more on tablets than on smartphones.</li>
<li>People are watching almost 60% more TV shows on tablets than on smartphones.</li>
<li>People are watching 28% less user generated content (e.g. YouTube) on tablets than on smartphones.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whenaretheywatching">When are they watching</h3>

<p>People are spending more and more time watching video on their tablets. They&apos;re watching longer form content. It&apos;s happening in homes, in lean back mode, in bed or on the couch. The busiest tablet usage times seem to be <a href="http://pando.com/2013/09/26/peak-times-for-smart-devices-primetime-for-entertainment-morning-commute-for-news/?ref=localhost">between 5PM to 10pm</a> (adjusted to person&apos;s local time).</p>

<h4 id="whatdoesthismean">What does this mean?</h4>

<p>Yeah, people might be on the couch watching some YouTube video, or more likely an episode of Parks and Recreation via Netflix, but regardless they&#x2019;re in a mode where they just want to be entertained, not to have to think, not to have to decide what button or widget to click that appears over a video.</p>

<p>There is already too high of a perceived cost in choosing what &#x201C;vanilla&#x201D; video to pick to watch. Adding interactive features on top of a video only increases the cost of choosing what  video to watch.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Schonfeld, I would love to see some empirical, non-self selecting, evidence that shows otherwise.</strong></p>

<p>In your interview you also said:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;What hasn&#x2019;t really happened yet is a revolution in creation &#x2013; everything we see is still a lean-back experience...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I often think that video on a tablet is lean-back for a reason. The tablet is something you hold. Something that has the opportunity to be closer to us than our TVs (both literally and  metaphorically speaking) and I&apos;d like to see the experience outside of the actual video get better, not what is plopped on top of the video I actually take the time to dig into and watch.</p>

<p>Yes, I think there will be some place for interactive video in the future and your insight into the timing is well thought out. The advances in bandwidth available to people and increased processing power in tablets will lead to some interesting things, but for the most part, people just want to be entertained as simply as possible.</p>

<p>I would love to continue this conversation and hear more of your thoughts on the future directions of online video.</p>

<p>Growing up I always had an affinity for the Swiss Army knife. Strike that, coveted the Swiss Army knife! If somehow you don&apos;t know about this modern marvel, let me tell you, you are missing out.</p>

<p>Can a Swiss Army Knife, a.k.a the multi-tool, be a <em>great</em> tool if its components aren&apos;t the best at their individual tasks? This post is an exploration around that question. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The Swiss Army knife has it all:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>large blade </li>
<li>small blade </li>
<li>Phillips screwdriver  </li>
<li>scissors </li>
<li>metal saw </li>
<li>metal file </li>
<li>wire stripper </li>
<li>bottle opener </li>
<li>key ring  </li>
<li>nail file with nail cleaner </li>
<li>toothpick </li>
<li>large screwdriver </li>
<li>multi purpose hook </li>
<li>reamer </li>
<li>fine screwdriver </li>
<li>pliers with:
<ul><li>wire crimping tool</li>
<li>wire cutters</li></ul></li>
<li>wood saw </li>
<li>tweezers </li>
<li>can opener</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WOW!</strong> All for the amazing low price of $84 (MSRP)!</p>

<p>Now you may say:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>That nifty tool sure does do a lot, but does it really excel at any one of those things?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I am buying a knife I probably won&apos;t buy it from Swiss Army. The blades in a Swiss Army multi-tool are usually not serrated and tend not to cut through the types of things I cut (ropes, cardboard, sails, yes strange things to cut). They&apos;re no <a href="http://www.wusthof.com/?ref=localhost">Wusthof</a>.</p>

<p>If I am buying a nail file, well, it definitely won&apos;t be from Swiss Army! It will be from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=nail+file&amp;ref=localhost">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>But...</strong></p>

<p>The Swiss Army knife is <strong>THE</strong> tool I reach for if I need to perform any multi-step task or any task that has an open ended problem. For instance:</p>

<p>I am a sailor. If there is a task that requires me to climb to the top of a mast, no matter what the task, I take with me two things: <br>
1. My knife. <br>
2. My multi-tool.</p>

<p>Not one or the other, but both. If I am going to need to seriously cut something, I&apos;ll use my knife. If I am going to open a shackle, multi-tool to the rescue! Close a cotter pin, multi-tool to the rescue!</p>

<p>In fact, I bring my multi-tool with me whenever I don&apos;t know what I&apos;ll be facing. It&apos;s with me in my car on a long trip. It&apos;s with me in my backpack on a long hike.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s take a look at this from another perspective.</p>

<p>Consider these two tools: A Swiss Army knife, a.k.a. the multi-tool, and a stand alone knife.</p>

<p>What would you say the job of each is?</p>

<p>The job of the knife is to do one thing and do it well. A good knife is engineered to be the best at what it does. To cut. </p>

<p>The multi-tool, on the other hand, is there to solve several <em>potential</em> problems. Its job is more ambiguous, more about making sure <em>your</em> job can get done no matter what comes up. </p>

<p><strong>Both are essential.</strong> Both are with me on my utility belt (yes, I do have one; no, I am not Batman).</p>

<p>So back to the question can the multi-tool be a great tool despite its components not being the best at their individual tasks?</p>

<p>The multi-tool is very good at the job it&apos;s built for. Helping you get through a task that is not clear cut, well defined, or that requires thinking on the fly. Adapting. Being available to you so that you can do whatever it takes to get the job done.</p>

<p>I&apos;ll stop here. Intentionally. </p>

<p>It&apos;s time to go to the food court and get lunch.</p>

I don&apos;t own a Swiss Army knife. Funny right? <br>
I do own a <a href="http://www.leatherman.com/18.html?ref=localhost#start=20">Leatherman skeletool</a>. Same deal. It does a bunch of things. And yes, it lives on my utility belt.</p>

<p>In May 2013 I found a new web series that I absolutely loved** but despite the fact that it was really funny and the topic was one that I feel like I live through every day, <strong>I could not keep up with it for the life of me</strong>. I probably watched 60% of the episodes published in the shows first &#x201C;season&#x201D; and I totally missed the boat when a second season came out.</p>

<p><strong>Who remembers to go back to that publishers page</strong> (within YouTube for instance) <strong>to check if something new has popped out?</strong></p>

<p>If you discovered the series early in its lifespan, the onus is on you to do the work to keep up.</p>

<p>If you found the series later on, awesome, binge away! But once again, when the next &#x201C;season&#x201D; (or whatever we are going to call bursts of episodes in the future) starts, good luck with that!</p>

<h2 id="nurturingahuntandpeckapproach">Nurturing a hunt and peck approach</h2>

<p>YouTube has been pushing viewers to subscribe to channels they find interesting and they will show you video from those sources when new content becomes available.</p>

<p>This has one main flaw: it predicates that you are buying into YouTube as your source of episodic web video and checking back in on a regular basis. The issue: this is a very lean forward approach. You, the viewer, have to remember a lot. Remember that you had something that you enjoyed on YouTube. Remember that the show you watched on YouTube is episodic and might come out with a new video in the next week or two. <strong>Just too much to remember for a supposedly relaxing thing to do!</strong></p>

<p>Blip.tv and Vimeo have similar offerings with episodic video series that you can &#x201C;follow&#x201D; and get actual notifications when new content is available. They realized that what YouTube is trying to do is too complex for the end user. The end user can&#x2019;t be left responsible to remember to come back to try and find that video series they thought was cool. It has to be simple. KISS.</p>

<h2 id="episodiccontentexistsbecauseofhabits">Episodic content exists because of habits</h2>

<p>I would postulate for the average consumer Blip, Vimeo and YouTube are all too complicated when it comes to video viewing habits though,especially for episodic content where follow up views must become a habit. Author Nir Eyal points out in his book <a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/work/hooked-how-build-habit-forming-products-ebook/B00HJ800RO/B00HJ4A43S?ref=localhost">Hooked</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#x201C;Habits form when the brain takes a shortcut and stops actively deliberating over what to do next.&#x201D;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What seems to be missing from the experience of trying to consume any episodic video on the web is <strong>that there are no shortcuts available to give the brain a rest</strong>. That little bit of rest is what most people are looking for when sitting back and watching something that is supposed to be entertaining.</p>

<p>Most people come home from work, sit on their couch, and just want to be entertained. They know that Monday night, Football is on; Thursday night, The Big Bang Theory is on; and Saturday night, SNL is on. <strong>It&#x2019;s all a habit</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="whatdoesthefutureholdforepisodicwebvideo">What does the future hold for episodic web video?</h3>

<p>While the production quality of episodic web video is making tremendous improvements (really tremendous) there is still no product out there with the reliability or ease of television (as most people know it) to form habits that will stick.</p>

With this traffic, we were able to do lots of A/B testing, load testing, and product development before our launch to prepare.</p>

<p>A question we hear a lot of is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#x201C;So, how&#x2019;d you get all that traffic before you launched?&#x201D;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is meant to be a high level, non-technical overview of what we did at Shelby to get us there. It&#x2019;s easier said than done but read on for strategies to get to your own 1 Million page views.</p>

<h2 id="definewhatyoumeanbylaunch">Define what you mean by LAUNCH.</h2>

<p>Launching a product can mean a variety of things to different people. An apparent lack of definition around WHAT a product launch means can be tough for some to come to grips with, but it&#x2019;s really a tool to use to your advantage!</p>

<p>At <a href="http://shelby.tv/?ref=localhost">Shelby.tv</a>, we had a product in &#x201C;beta&#x201D; for a few months that we were using to test ideas, concepts, and most importantly our API so that it was ready for the launch of our iPhone app.</p>

<p>Launch for us was releasing our app in the Apple App Store, going to the press with our story, sending about 45k emails, and a slew of other tactics to spread the word about our app.</p>

<h2 id="clearlydefineyouratomicunit">Clearly define your atomic unit.</h2>

<p>Definition can be helpful on so many levels, but especially when trying to generate an audience for whatever it is that you&#x2019;re working on.</p>

<p>We define Shelby.tv as the best way to discover and enjoy new videos everyday and our basic atomic unit (AU) is a Video.</p>

<p>I recently built a web app called <a href="http://bookmarked.it/?ref=localhost">Bookmarked.it</a> that surfaces quotes from all the books you have read on your Kindle. My AU is defined as a Quote. Simple. Very well defined.**</p>

<h2 id="getyourhandsonasmuchcontentaspossible">Get your hands on as much content as possible.</h2>

<p>Now that you&#x2019;ve defined your AU or content of your product, go out and get some! There are a bunch of ways to do this. You can create it yourself or you can have alpha or beta testers of your app generating it in some way, or you can harvest it from the web (maybe use the Twitter API to effectively simulate the type of content you are expecting to have on your site).</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>Because you can then go on to actually &#x201C;create&#x201D; simple, static HTML pages for whatever your AU is. Consider the following examples:</p>

<p>At Shelby.tv our AU is a Video and we happen to have a system that collects all of the videos a user sees from their Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr streams.</p>

<p>During a year&#x2019;s time we have amassed &gt;30 Million unique videos the Internet (tweets, status updates etc) in our database that we can create static pages for. Each of the pages we can now create includes a video, what people on social services have said about the video, and links to other related videos.</p>

<p>This method of generating traffic to your app doesn&#x2019;t need millions of AUs to work though!</p>

<p>What it does need to make it successful is a way to link everything together.</p>

<p>With my app Bookmarked.it, a page with a user&#x2019;s favorite quotes should have links to the book that they are from and other quotes from that book. This way when search engines crawl your site, they know how to traverse all of your content.</p>

<p>Bookmarked.it has a small number of users but has ~100x the number of static pages you can visit (compared to the number of users). That&#x2019;s the type of multiplier you are looking for.</p>

<h2 id="submityoursitetosearchengines">Submit your site to SEARCH ENGINES.</h2>

<p>You know what they say, &#x201C;if you&apos;ve got it, flaunt it&#x201D; and the same goes for your content. Now that you have all this content how do you use it to grow your site traffic?</p>

<p>Google, Bing and others allow you to explicitly tell them about your site and all this content you now have to show off. Take advantage of this opportunity. Google Webmaster Tools is simple enough and can help you get a sitemap submitted to Google in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>There are several ways to generate site maps. To generate ours at Shelby we used a Ruby gem called sitemap_generator which we found quiet effective and easy to use. A few simple commands and you can run a script that goes through your entire database to generate a sitemap index file for your entire site.Tell Google where this lives and you&#x2019;ll be growing site traffic in no time!</p>

<h2 id="gogogadgetorganicgrowth">(Go Go Gadget) Organic GROWTH.</h2>

<p>This is one of the methods we used to grow our site traffic past 1 Million page views per month. Mega-growth didn&#x2019;t happen overnight of course. Even with this method it took time to grow our site traffic above 1 Million page views. We had significant traffic to our site very quickly though, about one month to reach ~100k pageviews/mo and about three months to reach ~500k pageviews/mo.</p>

<p>So wrapping up, here&#x2019;s your checklist of what you need to do to make this work for you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define what you mean by launch.  </li>
<li>Clearly define your atomic unit.  </li>
<li>Get your hands on as much content as possible.  </li>
<li>Submit your content to search engines.  </li>
<li>Grow organically.</li>
</ol>

<p>At Shelby.tv we grew our traffic in this manner so that we could do A/B testing with significant traffic letting us build, test, iterate on a very rapid cycle. This approach was very helpful in getting us to where we are today.</p>

<p>And now that we launched, of course <strong>the real work is ahead of us.</strong></p>

<p>The idea: I was toying with accessing my highlights from my Kindle with Ruby. Well, why not build a service that collects all your highlights and sends you reminders of all the quotes you&apos;ve saved over the years, right? And who doesn&apos;t love sharing quotes! </p>

<p>It turns out what I&apos;ve started building is also a better way (IMHO) to browse the books you&apos;ve read on your Kindle than the solution Amazon offers.</p>

<p><strong>Bookmarked.it was born</strong></p>

<h4 id="myplatformofchoice">My platform of choice</h4>

<p>With <a href="https://www.nitrous.io/join/51gkIjnCT6k?ref=localhost">Nitrous.io</a> I provisioned a cloud box, got a pretty sweet IDE, and I even got a fully functional terminal! The best part is the ability to preview my work live while developing. Some alternatives have this but this was why I really didn&apos;t go with dual booting or developing just on a cloud box via ssh alone. <br>
<small>(I&apos;ve written more about using a Chromebook Pixel <a href="https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/3aa868ce3fa0?ref=localhost">here</a>)</small></p>

<h4 id="mystackofchoice">My stack of choice</h4>

<p>I built a simple Ruby on Rails application using Ruby 2.0, Rails 4 + Heroku. It&apos;s all in the cloud and all the rage! Development, staging and production!</p>

<p>I&apos;m using MongoDB as a datastore and rather than using the local instance of Mongo available on Nitrous.io, I decided to use a free MongoLab instance, mostly because when I started, I didn&apos;t think I could install Mongo, you now can. <strong>Database in the cloud!</strong></p>

<p>Most people might not include this, but I am using <a href="http://trello.com/?ref=localhost">Trello</a> to track my progress, help me remember where I left off, and where I&apos;m building next.</p>

<h4 id="connectingwithamazon">Connecting with Amazon</h4>

<p>By far the trickiest part of this project is fetching Kindle highlights on behalf of the people who signup for Bookmarked.it. Luckily I leaned on Github and found <a href="https://github.com/hsztul/kindle?ref=localhost">this repository</a> that more or less did what I wanted: connect to <a href="http://kindle.amazon.com/?ref=localhost">kindle.amazon.com</a> and get a users Kindle highlights. A git clone, pull request, and git push later I was ready to integrate Amazon Kindle highlights into Bookmarked.it!</p>

<p>Next up, I hooked up DelayedJob to run the processes that pulls users highlights from Amazon so that all that time consuming back and forth can be done asynchonously.</p>

<p>Heroku charges a pretty penny for running these background tasks. To limit the cost (this is a side project right?) I stumbled upon this background worker (and dyno) autoscaling tool called <a href="https://github.com/lostboy/workless?ref=localhost">workless</a>. Pretty cool right? I am paying pennies for Bookmarked.it so far, yay!</p>

<h4 id="thebuckstopshereakasecurity">The buck stops here (aka security)</h4>

<p>The one sticky part to this project is that connecting to Amazon requires me to hold onto a users Amazon password to allow Bookmarked.it to periodically poll for new highlights. I want to respect everyone that stubles upon this project to I implemented two security features from the get go:</p>

<ul>
<li>I made the decision to fork over the $$ to buy a SSL certificate so all requests (not only those used to signup/login) are sent over https. This is the one part of Bookmarked.it thats going to cost me. But it&apos;s important, so it&apos;s in. Period.</li>
<li>I decided to use the AES-256-CBC algorithm to encrypt users passwords that are stored in my Mongo instace (on Mongolab). The key used to encrypt and decrypt these passwords are not kept in this database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily <a href="https://dnsimple.com/r/1e7b9a744008d0?ref=localhost">DNSimple</a> makes it really easy to buy SSL certificats &amp;&amp; set them up with Heroku. Really simple. </p>

<p>(If you <a href="https://dnsimple.com/r/1e7b9a744008d0?ref=localhost">signup for DNSimple with this link</a> you and I will both get 1 month free!)</p>

<h4 id="buildingtimeweekends">Building time == Weekends</h4>

<p>By day I work at <a href="http://shelby.tv/?ref=localhost">Shelby.tv</a> as the team Entertainment Scientist, by night I work at Home as team dad, so I built Bookmarked.it on weekends during my toddler&apos;s nap time. That&apos;s it.</p>

<p>Overall, I&apos;m really enjoying this experiment! It feels great to open my Chromebook, connected to Nitrous.io and I get off to the races. Keeping the scope of &quot;what bookmarked.it is&quot; simple makes developing a very focussed endeavour.</p>

<h4 id="doyouhaveakindle">Do you have a Kindle?</h4>

<h4 id="doyouhighlightpassages">Do you highlight passages?</h4>

<h4 id="neverforgetthosegreatquotes">Never forget those great quotes!</h4>

<p>I&apos;m looking for people that are interested to try Bookmarked.it out. All feedback is welcome and appreciated!</p>

<p>I have lots of ideas for products, both for digital and physical products. A lot of people I know are like this. Under the right conditions ideas just flow. For some people it happens in the shower. For others it&apos;s on a run. Regardless <em>where</em> it happens, what you do with those ideas are what matter. <br>
<img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M8BQLay_plk/Ub0ps0QLNXI/AAAAAAAAC8s/ekCcn2n8Ffc/s1600/tip-of-the-iceberg-glacier-2048x2048.jpg" alt="cover"></p>

<p>Last week I had an idea.** </p>

<p>On of the first pieces of feedback I heard was:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That&apos;s too small an idea. You should think bigger! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thinking big is great, and for years that&apos;s what I tried to do. But I have a secret to tell you.</p>

<h4 id="thinkingbighasnevergottenmeanywhere">Thinking big has never gotten me anywhere.</h4>

<p>I&apos;ve actually never experienced &quot;thinging big&quot; as a thing that actually helped me get anywhere. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;ve <em>heard</em> it get people places, I&apos;ve just never <em>seen</em> it get anyone anywhere first hand.</p>

<p>Goals are great, right? Absolutely! As long as they are realistic that is. If my goal is to be President of the United States, well, that just not realistic. Maybe a good idea but not something I can make happen.</p>

<p>So with this idea, I&apos;m taking a different approach (than I normally would take at least).</p>

<h4 id="imstartingsmallandthinkinglittle">I&apos;m starting small and &quot;thinking little&quot;.</h4>

<p>I&apos;m asking myself questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>What&apos;s the simplest version of this idea?</li>
<li>What&apos;s the smallest incarnation of this idea that can be successful?</li>
<li>Will this little idea for a product/service work?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>...baby step onto the elevator... baby step into the elevator... I&apos;m <em>in</em> the elevator.
  -<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncFCdCjBqcE&amp;ref=localhost">Bob</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I can start to answer some of these questions and execute well, then it&apos;s time to think a little bigger and ask myself how what I&apos;ve learned can translate into something bigger.</p>

<p>I&apos;m learning successful big ideas comes from a well excecuted series of little ideas. It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t have big asperations. It&apos;s not that I can&apos;t see my little idea turn into something big. It is the case that I see my little idea having a better chance of seeing the day of light if I keep it little and realistic.</p>

<p>If I set a goal for myself to take my kids to the read a book to my kids every night. That is something meaningful. That is something worth working towards. That is something small that can go a long way. <strong>Thinking little to achieve something big.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Whats the smallest idea you can think of that you can execute will in a realistic time frame thats worth your while?</strong></p>

<hr style="margin: 5px;">

<p>** And almost no idea is truly original. Ideas do not form in a vacuum. Rather, ideas are born from a magical place where experience meets creativity. Most ideas are born from a connection that is made that connects things that exist in a new and interesting way some times with new and interesting constraints. This idea came and was advanced by discussions with several people.</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ghost in the house!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>This is a blog post written using <a href="http://tryghost.org/?ref=localhost">Ghost</a>...  <strong>BOO</strong>! <br>

<p>Overall my thoughts on Ghost so far: impressive project; looking forward to more themes being created; really looking forward to seeing what this team does in the coming year.</p>

<p>Getting all set up was pretty straight forward so I will try to summarize what it took below.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="createavirtualmachine">Create a virtual machine</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>I really like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=f8f0f9175757&amp;ref=localhost">Digital Ocean</a> more and more. The guys at Digital Ocean are building a solid cloud hosting product using SSD tech so I went with them. Did I mention that the base box costs <strong>$5/month!?!</strong> Its really simple to get started.  I setup a SSD cloud box with 512MB of RAM and 20GB HDD space in 2 min.</p></li>
<li><p>I created a user for myself to work with that has <em>sudo</em> privilages.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="installnodenpmforever">Install Node + NPM + Forever</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>Node: I used a package manager. Find instructions on how to <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager?ref=localhost">here</a>. Depending on your version of Ubuntu (or whatever you roll) you might need this: <br>
<code>sudo apt-get install software-properties-common</code></p></li>
<li><p>NPM: Depending on the version of node you install you might get npm for free when you install node. If not you should be able to tack on this after installing node: <br>
<code>sudo apt-get install npm</code></p></li>
<li><p>Forever: I am using forever to keep the node process that runs Ghost alive. To install Forever: <br>
<code>[sudo] npm install forever</code></p></li>
<li><p>Make sure all this worked. Try out: <br>
<code>node -v</code><br>
<code>forever --help</code></p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="downloadghost">Download Ghost</h4>

<p>Right now you need to be a backer of the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform?ref=localhost">Ghost kickstarter project</a> to download the source code. I&apos;m not how strict the Ghost team is about sharing the source code right now, but if you are interested in getting an early copy, email me <a href="mailto:ghostsourcecode@sztul.com">here</a> and I will inquire if its kosher on your behalf.</p>

<p>Once you have downloaded the source: <br>
1. unzip what you downloaded. duh. <br>
2. <code>cd</code> into the ghost directory. <br>
3. To start ghost all you need to do is run: <br>
    <code>npm install --production</code> <br>
but to get this puppy up and running for the world to see you must...  </p>

<h4 id="installnginx">Install NGINX</h4>

<p>Simple: <br>
<code>sudo apt-get install nginx</code><br>
Now to proxy things correctly (a little more challenging, probably the hardest part of all this)**:</p>

<pre><code># /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
http {
    ...
    include sites-enabled/*.conf;
    ...
}

# /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ghost.conf
upstream nodejs {
    server 127.0.0.1:2368;
}

server {
    server_name {yourservername.tld};
    root /path/to/ghost;

    access_log /path/to/ghost/access.log;
    error_log /path/to/ghost/error.log;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://nodejs;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Reload + restart nginx: <code>sudo service nginx restart</code> and you should be good to go!</p>

<p>I have a domain, ghost.sztul.com, pointed to this new box so the server name in the above code block points there. Bing, bang, boom, My ghost blog is live.</p>

<p>Now, the question, <strong>what to do with blog.sztul.com and how to transfer whats there to here!</strong></p>

<p>I found myself wanting to move between categories with my keyboard. <br>
The trick:</p>

<p>Use the <strong>` key</strong> to navigate between &#x2018;Primary&#x2019;, &#x2018;Social&#x2019;, etc.</p>

A Chromebook Pixel. A machine I never would have bought myself, but the more I use, the more I like.</p>

<p>As a second laptop, one that for the most part stays at home or comes with me on trips, the Pixel is just about perfect. Also it follows a paradigm that my 3yr old daughter expects (i.e. it has a touch screen).</p>

<p>Where the Pixel has fallen flat so far is as a machine to develop with. <br>
Until yesterday.</p>

<p>Over the weekend I left my Macbook Pro on my desk at Shelby.tv and ventured into the great unknown that is developing on the Pixel!</p>

<h3 id="step1developermode">Step 1: Developer Mode</h3>

<p>My first thought was I need shell access! Pressing ctrl-alt-T gets you a terminal but its crosh. So I endevoured to get my Pixel into developer mode which gets you a real shell to work in. I followed this helpful tutorial. Then I realized that while this was close to the right direction. It&#x2019;s not really what I need right now.</p>

<h3 id="step2embracethecloud">Step 2: Embrace the Cloud</h3>

<p>My framework of choice is Ruby on Rails and for the most part when I build something on the side, it&#x2019;s using Heroku. So the next step on my journey was getting a cloud server to develop on which I could then connect to Github, Heroku, etc.</p>

<p>The guys at Digital Ocean are building a solid cloud hosting product using SSD tech so I went with them. Did I mention that the base box costs $5/month!?!</p>

<p>SSH onto that box. Set that machine up. Git, Vim, Heroku to your hearts delight. <br>
BUT I&#x2019;m a web developer and I want actually see and feel what it is I am working on. In my browser. Not just in the code. So&#x2026;</p>

<h3 id="step3reallyembracethecloud">Step 3: REALLY Embrace the Cloud</h3>

<p>Enter Cloud 9. Cloud 9 gives you a pretty full fledged IDE experience (pictured below). You can push and pull to Git to your hearts delight. Although I couldn&#x2019;t get the feature to work properly you are also supposed to be able to deploy to Heroku too.</p>

<p>So my workflow over the weekend was: <br>
1) open a new window in ChromeOS <br>
2) open Cloud 9 in one tab <br>
3) open the terminal ssh&#x2019;d into my new cloud box in another tab. <br>
4) I write code in Cloud 9 push it to Github and in the tab with my terminal, I pull changes and deploy to Heroku!</p>

<p>One additional way to improve this workflow in the future is going to be to create a &#x201C;scrap&#x201D; directory in my apps where I code pure html that I can preview in Cloud 9 before I add any ruby erb goodness.</p>

<h4 id="staytuned">Stay tuned</h4>

<p>This can&#x2019;t be the ideal setup, so I&#x2019;ll be updating this post in the near future. <br>
I&#x2019;d love to hear if you have any other tips for developing on this machine</p>

<p>Were they going to follow the old model of premiering on TV only or were they going to be somewhat forward thinking , be all hip and cool, and let me watch the season 3 premier on my iPad?</p>

<p>The answer: <strong>Hip and cool. all. night. long.</strong></p>

<p>All the tiles that are normally there for movies and shows became one big ad for Game of Thrones. <br>
I watched the opening scene on the ipad using airplay assuming the experience would suck. Airplay has never been great for me, streaming &#x201C;live&#x201D; (quasi-live in this case) never really works well en-mass still, but to my shock, it was great!</p>

<p>The only use case I see for this type of consumption where I have to log in on my ipad to watch content that is available on my TV is leaching (i.e. using a family TWC password that is not directly in &#x201C;ones&#x201D; household to view HBO Go).</p>

<p>That all being said, it is really interesting to see the approach that HBO is taking versus Netflix. They seem to be converging from opposite ends of the media consumption curve and approaching the torso where content is largely on the device of your choosing and consumed at the time you wish.</p>

<p>The new TV model might be heading ala cart, it might be heading all on demand, it might be heading to Shelby.tv but what is for sure is that media is converging on the torso of the media consumption curve.</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Constraints and the walled garden phenomenon]]></title><description><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>AOL, Facebook, and iOS are each a walled garden in their own way.</p>

<p>I have never really understood why people flock to walled gardens on the Internet, until something clicked recently and now its clear as day to me, or at least as clear as this snowy day can be to me.</p>

<p>Walled gardens such as the ones listed above provide a few things (of course) but the one that I think is the most important is constraints. While I&#x2019;d like to think I dont need them (on the Internet) most people definitely do.</p>

<p>AOL provided clarity online when most people didn&#x2019;t know what to do or where to go as there was no instruction manual. AOL was their manual for the Internet.</p>

<p>Facebook provided a purpose for most people who were looking for a place that made sense to them to communicate with and learn more about their friends. Facebook was their happy place. <br>
iOS provided quality to the cell phone app environment and by setting standards and boundaries, people wanted in. iOS apps were wanted due to the bar set to be allowed in that marketplace.</p>

<p><strong>Good constraints act like a yellow brick road to get you from something you&#x2019;d like to do to actually getting that thing done.</strong></p>

<p>Constraints provide clarity, purpose, and quality.</p>

<p>The overall game experience seemed cool at first. Until I got ~5 sec. into the game. I have played the original Temple Run once or twice (ok, more like a lot) and knew I was looking for coins and looking to not run into or off of shit. What ensued was pretty funny.</p>

<p>I ran off bridges, into walls, and into rivers. <br>
I collected no coins (unless it were by chance) and overall I was left with a WTF moment. </p>

<p>I had no idea what was going on. Until I realized&#x2026; I am color blind and this games color scheme was TOTALLY not designed for me. The coins blend in with the ground. The turns are mostly masked by color similarities. Totally unusable for me! </p>

<p>After recently reading this article about how Duck Hunt works I was left with thinking about the importance of contrast and simplicity in design. In Duck Hunt, the sky is blue and the birds are white/black. So easy to establish what you&#x2019;re objective is and how to obtain it. In Temple Run 2, the ground and the coins are each a different hue of yellow (i think).</p>

<p>Setting users up for success in an app means being explicitly clear what&#x2019;s going on at all times. What is going on and what is expected should be crystal clear.</p>

<p>The creators of Temple Run probably did not consider the color blind when designing. Thats forgivable and probably understandable. BUT what they should have considered is creating and using contrast to establish what should be done in the game. Instead, they are relying on the success of their first game.</p>

<p><strong>Note to self: Be explicit and and design with contrast in mind when building anything going forward.</strong></p><!--kg-card-end: html-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Simple is hard.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>You hear over and over things like &#x201C;ideas are a dime a dozen&quot; and &#x201C;talk is cheap&quot; where the overarching message is that execution is king.

<p>Simple ideas are hard to come by.</p>

<p>Execution of a simple idea is harder than it seems (much harder).</p>

<p>There is tremendous value in simplifying the complex.</p>

<p>I am making it a priority to keep these three points on simplicity (or complexity) when evaluating other products or my own.</p>

<p>You often hear about people saying Twitter is so simple (technically speaking), nothing special there. Well guess what. Executing on that simple idea of what Twitter started as and solving the complexities that must have popped up along the way, is incredibly hard and impressive. </p>

<p><strong>Now think: If executing on some simple idea is hard, whats it like to execute on something hard?</strong></p><!--kg-card-end: html-->]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
